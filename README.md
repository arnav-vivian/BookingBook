A travel booking website is an online platform that allows users to search, compare and book hotels for their stay. 
These websites typically offer a wide range of accommodation options, from budget-friendly hostels to luxury resorts, 
and provide users with information such as hotel amenities, room rates, availability, and guest reviews. Users can also
filter search results based on their preferences, such as location, price range, and hotel type. Additionally, many hotel 
booking websites offer discounts and special promotions, making it easy for users to find the best deals on their desired accommodation.
Once a user selects a hotel, they can complete their booking and payment through the website, often receiving a confirmation email with details about their stay.!
